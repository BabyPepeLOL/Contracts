# 🐸 Top Pepe Project 🚀

Welcome to the official GitHub repository for the Top Pepe project!

##Escape The Matrix!

Top Pepe, a crypto-meme project, is revolutionizing the DeFi world with its quirky and innovative approach. We believe in the power of memes and the joy they bring, and we've channeled this spirit into our tokenomics and smart contracts. 

In this repository, you'll find a collection of contracts governing the Top Pepe ecosystem. Here's a quick rundown:

- **Top Pepe Token Contract (`BabyPepeERC20.sol`):** This is where the magic begins. We've minted our very own Top Pepe tokens (symbol: TopP) that will make you hop with joy as you witness its mighty potential.

- **Top Pepe Airdrop Contract (`BabyPepeAirdrop.sol`):** We love our community, and what better way to show our appreciation than by air-dropping tokens? This contract also takes care of our exclusive Pepe Holder NFTs. Hold onto your hats, this one's a real gem!

- **Top Pepe Farm Contract (`BabePepeFarming.sol`):** We've made it super easy to stake your tokens and earn rewards in this liquidity mining contract. Stake your tokens, sit back, relax, and watch your rewards roll in!

# ❗ Note: 
No contract has been professionally audited, please DYOR. Find AI generated audit reports in the AI-Audit folder. Please check the contract code is the same as deployed contract before use. This is a very experimental project.

Remember, this is a community-driven project. We encourage you to dig into the code, ask questions, and suggest improvements. Let's make DeFi fun again with Top Pepe! 🐸🌌🌕

(Note: While we love having fun, we take the security of our contracts very seriously. All our contracts have been thoroughly tested. Please make sure you understand the risks involved with DeFi before getting involved.)
